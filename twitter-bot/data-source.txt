AND YET THE BOOKS 
By Czeslaw Milosz - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czes%C5%82aw_Mi%C5%82osz
And yet the books will be there on the shelves, separate beings,
That appeared once, still wet
As shining chestnuts under a tree in autumn,
And, touched, coddled, began to live
In spite of fires on the horizon, castles blown up,
Tribes on the march, planets in motion.
“We are,” they said, even as their pages
Were being torn out, or a buzzing flame
Licked away their letters. So much more durable
Than we are, whose frail warmth
Cools down with memory, disperses, perishes.
I imagine the earth when I am no more:
Nothing happens, no loss, it's still a strange pageant,
Women's dresses, dewy lilacs, a song in the valley.
Yet the books will be there on the shelves, well born,
Derived from people, but also from radiance, heights.
THERE IS NO FRIGATE LIKE A BOOK
By Emily Dickinson - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson
There is no Frigate like a Book 
To take us Lands away 
Nor any Coursers like a Page 
Of prancing Poetry – 
This Traverse may the poorest take 
Without oppress of Toll – 
How frugal is the Chariot 
That bears the Human Soul –
KILL THE HOWLING MOB

Kill the howling mob
Their bibliophobia
The library burns
Murder the arsonists 
And their hatred of books
IN THE LIBRARY
by Charles Simic - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Simic
(for Octavio)
There’s a book called
"A Dictionary of Angels."
No one has opened it in fifty years,
I know, because when I did,
The covers creaked, the pages
Crumbled. There I discovered
The angels were once as plentiful
As species of flies.
The sky at dusk
Used to be thick with them.
You had to wave both arms
Just to keep them away.
Now the sun is shining
Through the tall windows.
The library is a quiet place.
Angels and gods huddled
In dark unopened books.
The great secret lies
On some shelf Miss Jones
Passes every day on her rounds.
She's very tall, so she keeps
Her head tipped as if listening.
The books are whispering.
I hear nothing, but she does.
MY FIRST MEMORY (OF LIBRARIANS)
by Yolande Cornelia "Nikki" Giovanni, Jr. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Giovanni
This is my first memory:
A big room with heavy wooden tables that sat on a creaky
     wood floor
A line of green shades—bankers’ lights—down the center
Heavy oak chairs that were too low or maybe I was simply
     too short
          For me to sit in and read
So my first book was always big
In the foyer up four steps a semi-circle desk presided
To the left side the card catalogue
On the right newspapers draped over what looked like
     a quilt rack
Magazines face out from the wall
The welcoming smile of my librarian
The anticipation in my heart
All those books - another world - just waiting
At my fingertips.
A LIBRARY
by Nikki Giovanni - http://www.nikki-giovanni.com/
(for Kelli Martin)
a Library Is:
a place to be free
to be in space
to be in cave times
to be a cook
to be a crook
to be in love
to be unhappy
to be quick and smart
to be contained and cautious
to surf the rainbow
to sail the dreams
to be blue
to be jazz
to be wonderful
to be you
a place to be
yeah… to be
